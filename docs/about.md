## About the Creator

Hi, I’m **Yunier**, a software developer passionate about automation, developer experience, and shipping projects efficiently.  
Sombra began as a personal side project to solve a recurring pain: starting new projects from scratch — again and again.

## About the Project

**Sombra CLI** is an open-source command-line tool designed to help developers, consultants, and teams standardize and accelerate project creation.  
It lets you turn existing production-ready code into reusable templates — without changing the original source.

The project started as an internal tool but is now open source (MIT License) and actively evolving.  
Sombra is ideal for scenarios like:

- Automating the setup of boilerplate code
- Managing many similar services (e.g. in microservice architectures)
- Sharing a consistent base across projects or clients

## Philosophy

Sombra is built around two core ideas:

1. **Use what already works** — start from proven codebases, not custom-built templates.
2. **Automate without intruding** — no runtime dependencies or changes to the production logic.
